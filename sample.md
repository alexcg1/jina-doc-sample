# Common Design Pattern

Jina is a flexible neural search framework powered by AI, which is designed to enable any pattern that can be framed as a neural search problem. However, there are some basic common patterns that show up while developing the search solutions with Jina. Here is a recompilation of some of them below for your detailed reference when building a neural search solution with Jina.

`- CompoundIndexer (Vector + KV Indexers):`

To develop neural search applications, it is helpful to use a CompoundIndexer in the same Pod for both the index and query flows. The following json file shows an example of this pattern:

```
!CompoundIndexer
components:
  - !NumpyIndexer
    with:
      index_filename: vectors.gz
      metric: cosine
    metas:
      name: vecIndexer
  - !BinaryPbIndexer
    with:
      index_filename: values.gz
    metas:
      name: kvIndexer  # a customized name
    metas:
      name: complete indexer
```

This type of construction will act as a single indexer and will allow to seamlessly query this index with the embedding vector coming from any upstream encoder and obtain, in the response message of the pod, the corresponding binary information stored in the key-value index. This allows the VectorIndexer be responsible to obtain the most relevant documents by finding similarities in the embedding space, while targeting the key-value database to extract the meaningful data and fields from those relevant documents.
